## ⚠ About

I did this project for fun and to test my skills, unfortunately it took a lot more time than I expected, so I had to abandon it. It's fully complete and playable. The project uses Super Metroid resources (Sprites/SFX), except in last level Chozodia (I can't draw, so I used originla GBA sprites). There are some places where precise jumps are needed to progress. AI is basic, there are some bugs, for example, it's possible to stuck between collisions, so it's better to save often.
