## ⚠ About

I created this project for fun and to test my skills. Unfortunately, it took much longer than I expected, and I ultimately had to abandon it. However, it is fully complete and playable. The project utilizes resources from Super Metroid (sprites and sound effects), except in the final level, Chozodia, where I couldn’t draw and used the original GBA sprites instead.

There are some areas where precise jumps are required to progress. The AI is basic, and there are a few bugs; for example, it's possible to become stuck between collisions, so it's advisable to save often.
